                       Hi, my name is Dejenu Feleke. I am passionate about data analysis and have a good understanding of end-to-end BI solutions development process. 
                       As part of my study I have worked on projects that involve data modeling, cleansing and transformation, analysis and insightful report development.
                       I  studied Microsoft Excel, SSIS, Power BI, SQL Server, T-SQL, and DAX. <br>
                       As Business Intelligence developer, I deeply envision to bridge the gap between stored raw data and informed decision making. 
                       I believe raw datasets are accumulated but untold stories, and yet datasets don't have the voice they need to tell those fabulous stories and that will be my job. <br>
                       I really love spending time playing with my kids, reading books and attending church.
